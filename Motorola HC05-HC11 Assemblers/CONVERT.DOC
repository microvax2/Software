			Documentation for CONVERT.EXE
			 (a file converstion utility)

CONVERT.EXE is a file conversion utility which takes Motorola S-record
files as input and converts them to a memory image format.  You are prompted
for all parameters after invoking the program.	The following is a list of
the parameters required and a description of each:

	Prom Size:	The size of the output file in K bytes.
	Input File:	The name of the S-record input file.
	Output File:	The name to be assigned to the output file.
			(existing files will be overwritten)
	Offset: 	The byte offset to be subtracted from the addresses
			in the input file.

After responding to all of the above requests, the input file is read and
converted.

Notes about conversion:
	No error checking is done in this conversion.  The input file is
	searched for a line with a '1' as the second character.  When found,
	the length, and address are then read.	The number of bytes specified
	by length are then read as data.  The checksum byte is ignored.

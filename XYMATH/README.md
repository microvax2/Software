          Users of XYmath must accept this disclaimer of warranty:
          "XYmath is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all
          warranties, expressed or implied, including, without
          limitation, the warranties of merchantability and of fitness
          for any purpose. The author assumes no liability for damages,
          direct or conse-quential, which may result from the use of
          XYmath."

THE SHAREWARE CONCEPT:
          
          Sharware is a DISTRIBUTION concept whereby interested users
          may evaluate software at no cost.  Users are able to evaluate
          the software on their own system(s), in their own special work
          environment, with no sales people involved. The evaluation
          period will vary from software to software, however, continued
          use of that code should be accompanied by payment to the
          author or software development firm.
          
          
          
          Copyright laws apply to shareware just as they do to
          commercial software. The primary difference between shareware
          and retail software is that with shareware you know if it's
          good or bad BEFORE you pay for it.
          
          As a software user, you benefit because you get to use the
          software to determine whether it meets your needs before you
          pay for it, and authors benefit because they are able to get
          their products into your hands without the hundreds of
          thousands of dollars in expenses it takes to launch a
          traditional retail software product.  There are many programs
          on the market today which would never have become available
          without the shareware marketing method.
          
          The shareware system and the continued availability of quality
          shareware products depend on your willingness to register and
          pay for the shareware you use.  It's the registration fees you
          pay which allow us to support and continue to develop our
          products.
          
          Please show your support for shareware by registering those
          programs you actually use and by passing them on to others.
                              
          
          XYmath has an authorized evaluation period of one month.
          After one month of evaluation, if the code is worthy of
          continued use, a registered copy of XYmath should be purchased
          for $50.  A check or money order should be sent to

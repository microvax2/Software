 Short Description:

	ECU V1.5 is a shareware Sky Visualization Program for Microsoft 
 Windows 3.x called "The Earth Centered Universe".  It is capable of 
 simulating many of the features of the Earth's sky.  You only need to 
 enter your geographic location and the time and the local sky is
 simulated on the screen in a colourful display.  This includes, but 
 is not  limited to the stars, planets, Sun, Moon, comets, asteroids, and
 "deep sky" objects.  Constellation, Constellation boundary, coordinate 
 grid, ecliptic, and local horizon lines are also displayed.  It prints 
 high quality star charts to any Windows-compatible printer and also controls
 modern computerized telescopes.

	ECU is designed as an observing tool for the observing amateur 
 astronomer, but is equally useful to the "armchair" astronomer or 
 other interested person interested in the night sky.
